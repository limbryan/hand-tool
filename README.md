# About 
Individual project for the Design and Manufacture (ME2-DMF) course. The design report submitted can be found [here](https://github.com/limbryan/hand-tool/blob/master/ME2%20Individual%20Hand%20Tool%20Design%20Report%20-%20Bryan%20Lim.pdf).

All 3D CAD models seen throughout the report was modelled from scratch using SolidWorks. The design report may seem slightly cluttered and packed due to the page limit constrain present in the report. This was a calculated risk to include the detailed information of the analysis carried out in designing the tool.
